## Project Overview

1️⃣ [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/48TmCzIE/labs-pt9-artificial-artist)

2️⃣ [Product Canvas](https://www.notion.so/Artificial-Artist-1934140bf39c4f2ba1b8910de0ee0d41)

The Artificial Artist is a brand new music visualization experience. Combining music with generative adversarial network (GAN) images, users can create unique music visualization videos. 

## Key Features

-   Create your own music visualization videos
-   Browse other user's videos
-   Advance settings give users the ability to customize their videos


## Tech Stack

### Front end built using:

#### 1️⃣ Reactjs ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-v16.13.1-blue.svg)

-    Declarative --Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.
-    Component-Based --Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
-    Learn Once, Write Anywhere --You can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code

#### 2️⃣ Redux ![Redux](https://img.shields.io/badge/redux-v4.0.5-blueviolet.svg)
 
-   Single immutable state tree
-   Ease of Testing
-   Global Store of App State

#### Front end deployed to `AWS Amplify`

#### [Back end](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/artificial-artist-fe/edit/master/README.md) built using:

#### 1️⃣ Node Express ![Express](https://img.shields.io/badge/express-v4.17.1-lightgrey.svg)

-    Great performance! Node was designed to optimize throughput and scalability in web applications and is a good solution for many common web-development problems (e.g. real-time web applications).
-    Code is written in "plain old JavaScript", which means that less time is spent dealing with "context shift" between languages when you're writing both client-side and server-side code.
-    The node package manager (NPM) provides access to hundreds of thousands of reusable packages. It also has best-in-class dependency resolution and can also be used to automate most of the build toolchain.

#### 2️⃣ PostgreSQL ![PostgreSQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/pg-v8.2.1-blue.svg)



# APIs

## 1️⃣ jsonwebtoken

Once the user is logged in, each subsequent request will include the JWT, allowing the user to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token. Single Sign On is a feature that widely uses JWT nowadays, because of its small overhead and its ability to be easily used across different domains.

## 2️⃣ https://developers.deezer.com/api/search

The API gives users access to the site's data making it available for use in third party web sites and applications. This data includes albums, artists, comments, editorials, folders, playlists, radio, searches, tracks and users. The API uses HTTP calls and responses are formatted in XML, JSON and PHP.


# Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

    *  REACT_APP_SERVER_URL - for your local development server
